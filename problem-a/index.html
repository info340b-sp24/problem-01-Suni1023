        <h2 class="description">About Qiu Shenji</h2>
        <p>
            Qiu Shenji was a famous figure during the Wu Zhou period of China, who was modeled after none other than Qiu Shenji, the general of Zuo Jingwuwei. 
            This brave and warlike hero left many legendary stories in history. However, Qiu Qingzhi did not have a happy ending. In the second year of Tianzhu (691), 
            he was framed for treason and was executed in prison. Despite his complex and multi-faceted image in history, it is undeniable that he was a valiant general who made great contributions to the country.
